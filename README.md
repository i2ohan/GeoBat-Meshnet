# GeoBat-Meshnet
We created a firebase messaging application that has the facility to communicate with the authorities and retrieve the GPS coordinates of their respective locations. In case of natural calamities and war when signal jammers are used and all the signal towers are down, we  create our own mesh network with the help of Raspberry Pi acting as nodes deployed in the perimeter.
